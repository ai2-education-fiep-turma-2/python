THE SONNETS

by William Shakespeare



                     1
  fairest creatures desire increase,
  beauty's rose die,
  riper time decease,
  tender heir bear memory:
  thou contracted thine bright eyes,
  Feed'st thy light's flame self-substantial fuel,
  Making famine abundance lies,
  Thy thy foe, thy sweet cruel:
  Thou art world's fresh ornament,
  herald gaudy spring,
  thine bud buriest thy content,
  tender churl mak'st waste niggarding:
    Pity world, glutton be,
    eat world's due, grave thee.


                     2
  forty winters besiege thy brow,
  dig deep trenches thy beauty's field,
  Thy youth's proud livery gazed now,
  tattered weed small worth held:  
  asked, thy beauty lies,
  treasure thy lusty days;
  thine deep sunken eyes,
  all-eating shame, thriftless praise.
  praise deserved thy beauty's use,
  thou couldst answer 'This fair child mine
  sum count, make excuse'
  Proving beauty succession thine.
    made thou art old,
    thy blood warm thou feel'st cold.


                     3
  thy glass face thou viewest,
  time face form another,
  fresh repair thou renewest,
  Thou dost beguile world, unbless mother.
  fair uneared womb
  Disdains tillage thy husbandry?
  fond tomb,
  self-love stop posterity?  
  Thou art thy mother's glass thee
  Calls back lovely April prime,
  thou windows thine age shalt see,
  wrinkles thy golden time.
    thou live remembered be,
    Die single thine image dies thee.


                     4
  Unthrifty loveliness dost thou spend,
  thy thy beauty's legacy?
  Nature's bequest doth lend,
  frank lends free:
  beauteous niggard dost thou abuse,
  bounteous largess thee give?
  Profitless usurer dost thou use
  great sum sums canst live?
  traffic thy alone,
  Thou thy thy sweet dost deceive,
  nature calls thee gone,
  acceptable audit canst thou leave?  
    Thy unused beauty tombed thee,
    lives th' executor be.


                     5
  hours gentle work frame
  lovely gaze eye doth dwell
  play tyrants same,
  unfair fairly doth excel:
  never-resting time leads summer on
  hideous winter confounds there,
  Sap checked frost lusty leaves gone,
  Beauty o'er-snowed bareness where:
  summer's distillation left
  liquid prisoner pent walls glass,
  Beauty's effect beauty bereft,
  remembrance was.
    flowers distilled winter meet,
    Leese show, substance lives sweet.


                     6  
  winter's ragged hand deface,
  thee thy summer ere thou distilled:
  Make sweet vial; treasure thou place,
  beauty's treasure ere self-killed:
  forbidden usury,
  happies pay loan;
  thy breed thee,
  ten times happier ten one,
  Ten times thy happier thou art,
  ten thine ten times refigured thee:
  death thou shouldst depart,
  Leaving thee living posterity?
    self-willed thou art fair,
    death's conquest make worms thine heir.


                     7
  Lo orient gracious light
  Lifts burning head, eye
  Doth homage new-appearing sight,
  Serving sacred majesty,  
  climbed steep-up heavenly hill,
  Resembling strong youth middle age,
  mortal adore beauty still,
  Attending golden pilgrimage:
  highmost pitch weary car,
  feeble age reeleth day,
  eyes (fore duteous) converted are
  low tract way:
    thou, thy out-going thy noon:
    Unlooked diest thou son.


                     8
  Music hear, hear'st thou music sadly?
  Sweets sweets war not, joy delights joy:
  lov'st thou thou receiv'st gladly,
  receiv'st pleasure thine annoy?
  true concord well-tuned sounds,
  unions married offend thine ear,
  sweetly chide thee, confounds
  singleness parts thou shouldst bear:  
  Mark string sweet husband another,
  Strikes mutual ordering;
  Resembling sire, child, happy mother,
  one, pleasing note sing:
    speechless song many, one,
    Sings thee, 'Thou single wilt prove none'.


                     9
  fear wet widow's eye,
  thou consum'st thy single life?
  Ah, thou issueless shalt hap die,
  world wail thee makeless wife,
  world thy widow weep,
  thou form thee hast left behind,
  private widow keep,
  children's eyes, husband's shape mind:
  unthrift world doth spend
  Shifts place, world enjoys it;
  beauty's waste hath world end,
  unused user destroys it:  
    love bosom sits
    murd'rous shame commits.


                     10
  shame deny thou bear'st love any
  thy art unprovident.
  Grant thou wilt, thou art beloved many,
  thou lov'st evident:
  thou art possessed murd'rous hate,
  'gainst thy thou stick'st conspire,
  Seeking beauteous roof ruinate
  repair thy chief desire:
  O change thy thought, change mind,
  hate fairer lodged gentle love?
  thy presence gracious kind,
  thy kind-hearted prove,
    Make thee love me,
    beauty live thine thee.


                     11  
  fast thou shalt wane fast thou grow'st,
  thine, thou departest,
  fresh blood youngly thou bestow'st,
  Thou mayst call thine, thou youth convertest,
  lives wisdom, beauty, increase,
  folly, age, cold decay,
  minded so, times cease,
  threescore year make world away:
  nature hath made store,
  Harsh, featureless, rude, barrenly perish:
  endowed, gave thee more;
  bounteous gift thou shouldst bounty cherish:
    carved thee seal, meant thereby,
    Thou shouldst print more, copy die.


                     12
  count clock tells time,
  brave day sunk hideous night,
  behold violet past prime,
  sable curls silvered o'er white:  
  lofty trees barren leaves,
  erst heat canopy herd
  summer's green girded sheaves
  Borne bier white bristly beard:
  thy beauty question make
  thou wastes time go,
  sweets beauties forsake,
  die fast grow,
    'gainst Time's scythe make defence
    Save breed brave him, takes thee hence.


                     13
  O self, love are
  longer yours, live,
  coming end prepare,
  sweet semblance give.
  beauty hold lease
  Find determination, were
  self's decease,
  sweet issue sweet form bear.  
  lets fair house fall decay,
  husbandry honour uphold,
  stormy gusts winter's day
  barren rage death's eternal cold?
    O unthrifts, dear love know,
    father, son so.


                     14
  stars judgement pluck,
  methinks astronomy,
  good, evil luck,
  plagues, dearths, seasons' quality,
  fortune minutes tell;
  Pointing thunder, rain wind,
  princes well
  oft predict heaven find.
  thine eyes knowledge derive,
  constant stars read art
  truth beauty thrive
  thy self, store thou wouldst convert:  
    thee prognosticate,
    Thy end truth's beauty's doom date.


                     15
  thing grows
  Holds perfection moment.
  huge stage presenteth nought shows
  Whereon stars secret influence comment.
  perceive men plants increase,
  Cheered checked self-same sky:
  Vaunt youthful sap, height decrease,
  wear brave state memory.
  conceit inconstant stay,
  Sets rich youth sight,
  wasteful time debateth decay
  change day youth sullied night,
    war Time love you,
    takes you, engraft new.


                     16  
  wherefore mightier way
  Make war bloody tyrant Time?
  fortify decay
  means blessed barren rhyme?
  stand top happy hours,
  maiden gardens unset,
  virtuous bear living flowers,
  liker painted counterfeit:
  lines life life repair
  (Time's pencil) pupil pen
  worth outward fair
  make live eyes men.
    give self, still,
    live drawn sweet skill.


                     17
  verse time come
  filled high deserts?
  heaven tomb
  hides life, shows half parts:  
  write beauty eyes,
  fresh numbers number graces,
  age poet lies,
  heavenly touches ne'er touched earthly faces.
  papers (yellowed age)
  scorned, men truth tongue,
  true rights termed poet's rage,
  stretched metre antique song.
    child alive time,
    live it, rhyme.


                     18
  compare thee summer's day?
  Thou art lovely temperate:
  Rough winds shake darling buds May,
  summer's lease hath short date:
  hot eye heaven shines,
  gold complexion dimmed,
  fair fair declines,
  chance, nature's changing untrimmed:  
  thy eternal summer fade,
  lose possession fair thou ow'st,
  death brag thou wand'rest shade,
  eternal lines time thou grow'st,
    long men breathe eyes see,
    long lives this, life thee.


                     19
  Devouring Time blunt thou lion's paws,
  make earth devour sweet brood,
  Pluck keen teeth fierce tiger's jaws,
  burn long-lived phoenix, blood,
  Make glad seasons thou fleet'st,
  whate'er thou wilt swift-footed Time
  wide world fading sweets:
  forbid thee heinous crime,
  O carve thy hours love's fair brow,
  draw lines thine antique pen,
  thy untainted allow,
  beauty's pattern succeeding men.  
    thy worst Time: thy wrong,
    love verse live young.


                     20
  woman's face nature's hand painted,
  Hast thou master mistress passion,
  woman's gentle heart acquainted
  shifting change false women's fashion,
  eye bright theirs, false rolling:
  Gilding object gazeth,
  man hue hues controlling,
  steals men's eyes women's souls amazeth.
  woman wert thou created,
  Till nature wrought thee fell a-doting,
  addition thee defeated,
  adding thing purpose nothing.
    pricked thee women's pleasure,
    Mine thy love thy love's treasure.


                     21  
  muse,
  Stirred painted beauty verse,
  heaven ornament doth use,
  fair fair doth rehearse,
  Making couplement proud compare
  sun moon, earth sea's rich gems:
  April's first-born flowers things rare,
  heaven's air huge rondure hems.
  O true love write,
  me, love fair,
  mother's child, bright
  gold candles fixed heaven's air:
    hearsay well,
    praise purpose sell.


                     22
  glass persuade old,
  long youth thou date,
  thee time's furrows behold,
  death days expiate.  
  beauty doth cover thee,
  seemly raiment heart,
  thy breast doth live, thine me,
  elder thou art?
  O love thyself wary,
  self, thee will,
  Bearing thy heart chary
  tender nurse babe faring ill.
    Presume thy heart mine slain,
    Thou gav'st thine give back again.


                     23
  unperfect actor stage,
  fear put part,
  fierce thing replete rage,
  strength's abundance weakens heart;
  fear trust, forget say,
  perfect ceremony love's rite,
  mine love's strength decay,
  O'ercharged burthen mine love's might:  
  O eloquence,
  dumb presagers speaking breast,
  plead love, recompense,
  tongue hath expressed.
    O learn read silent love hath writ,
    hear eyes belongs love's fine wit.


                     24
  Mine eye hath played painter hath stelled,
  Thy beauty's form table heart,
  body frame 'tis held,
  perspective painter's art.
  painter skill,
  find true image pictured lies,
  bosom's shop hanging still,
  hath windows glazed thine eyes:
  good turns eyes eyes done,
  Mine eyes drawn thy shape, thine me
  windows breast, where-through sun
  Delights peep, gaze thee;  
    eyes cunning grace art,
    draw see, heart.


                     25
  favour stars,
  public honour proud titles boast,
  Whilst fortune triumph bars
  Unlooked joy honour most;
  Great princes' favourites fair leaves spread,
  marigold sun's eye,
  pride lies buried,
  frown glory die.
  painful warrior famoused fight,
  thousand victories foiled,
  book honour razed quite,
  rest forgot toiled:
    happy love beloved
    remove removed.


                     26  
  Lord love, vassalage
  Thy merit hath duty strongly knit;
  thee send written embassage
  witness duty, show wit.
  Duty great, wit poor mine
  make bare, wanting words show it;
  hope good conceit thine
  thy soul's thought (all naked) bestow it:
  Till whatsoever star guides moving,
  Points graciously fair aspect,
  puts apparel tattered loving,
  show worthy thy sweet respect,
    dare boast love thee,
    Till then, show head thou mayst prove me.


                     27
  Weary toil, haste bed,
  dear respose limbs travel tired,
  begins journey head
  work mind, body's work's expired.  
  thoughts (from abide)
  Intend zealous pilgrimage thee,
  drooping eyelids open wide,
  darkness blind see.
  Save soul's imaginary sight
  Presents thy shadow sightless view,
  jewel (hung ghastly night)
  Makes black night beauteous, face new.
    Lo day limbs, night mind,
    thee, self, quiet find.


                     28
  return happy plight
  debarred benefit rest?
  day's oppression eased night,
  day night night day oppressed.
  (though enemies either's reign)
  consent shake hands torture me,
  toil, complain
  toil, farther thee.  
  day thou art bright,
  dost grace clouds blot heaven:
  flatter swart-complexioned night,
  sparkling stars twire thou gild'st even.
    day doth daily draw sorrows longer,
    night doth nightly make grief's length stronger


                     29
  disgrace Fortune men's eyes,
  beweep outcast state,
  trouble deaf heaven bootless cries,
  curse fate,
  Wishing rich hope,
  Featured him, friends possessed,
  Desiring man's art, man's scope,
  enjoy contented least,
  thoughts despising,
  Haply thee, state,
  (Like lark break day arising
  sullen earth) sings hymns heaven's gate,  
    thy sweet love remembered wealth brings,
    scorn change state kings.


                     30
  sessions sweet silent thought,
  summon remembrance things past,
  sigh lack thing sought,
  woes wail dear time's waste:
  drown eye (unused flow)
  precious friends hid death's dateless night,
  weep afresh love's long cancelled woe,
  moan th' expense vanished sight.
  grieve grievances foregone,
  heavily woe woe o'er
  sad account fore-bemoaned moan,
  pay paid before.
    thee (dear friend)
    losses restored, sorrows end.


                     31  
  Thy bosom endeared hearts,
  lacking supposed dead,
  reigns love love's loving parts,
  friends thought buried.
  holy obsequious tear
  Hath dear religious love stol'n mine eye,
  interest dead, appear,
  things removed hidden thee lie.
  Thou art grave buried love doth live,
  Hung trophies lovers gone,
  parts thee give,
  due many, thine alone.
    images loved, view thee,
    thou (all they) hast me.


                     32
  thou survive well-contented day,
  churl death bones dust cover
  shalt fortune re-survey
  poor rude lines thy deceased lover:  
  Compare bett'ring time,
  outstripped pen,
  Reserve love, rhyme,
  Exceeded height happier men.
  O vouchsafe loving thought,
  'Had friend's Muse grown growing age,
  dearer birth love brought
  march ranks equipage:
    died poets prove,
    style read, love'.


                     33
  Full glorious morning seen,
  Flatter mountain tops sovereign eye,
  Kissing golden face meadows green;
  Gilding pale streams heavenly alchemy:
  Anon permit basest clouds ride,
  ugly rack celestial face,
  forlorn world visage hide
  Stealing unseen west disgrace:  
  sun early morn shine,
  triumphant splendour brow,
  alack, hour mine,
  region cloud hath masked now.
    this, love whit disdaineth,
    Suns world stain, heaven's sun staineth.


                     34
  didst thou promise beauteous day,
  make travel cloak,
  base clouds o'ertake way,
  Hiding thy brav'ry rotten smoke?
  'Tis cloud thou break,
  dry rain storm-beaten face,
  man salve speak,
  heals wound, cures disgrace:
  thy shame give physic grief,
  thou repent, loss,
  Th' offender's sorrow lends weak relief
  bears strong offence's cross.  
    Ah tears pearl thy love sheds,
    rich, ransom ill deeds.


                     35
  grieved thou hast done,
  Roses thorns, silver fountains mud,
  Clouds eclipses stain moon sun,
  loathsome canker lives sweetest bud.
  men make faults, this,
  Authorizing thy trespass compare,
  corrupting salving thy amiss,
  Excusing thy sins thy sins are:
  thy sensual fault bring sense,
  Thy adverse party thy advocate,
  'gainst lawful plea commence:
  civil war love hate,
    accessary be,
    sweet thief sourly robs me.


                     36  
  confess twain,
  undivided loves one:
  blots remain,
  thy help, borne alone.
  loves respect,
  lives separable spite,
  alter love's sole effect,
  doth steal sweet hours love's delight.
  evermore acknowledge thee,
  bewailed guilt thee shame,
  thou public kindness honour me,
  thou honour thy name:
    so, love thee sort,
    thou mine, mine thy good report.


                     37
  decrepit father takes delight,
  active child deeds youth,
  I, made lame Fortune's dearest spite
  comfort thy worth truth.  
  beauty, birth, wealth, wit,
  all, all, more
  Entitled thy parts, crowned sit,
  make love engrafted store:
  lame, poor, despised,
  Whilst shadow doth substance give,
  thy abundance sufficed,
  part thy glory live:
    best, thee,
    have, ten times happy me.


                     38
  muse subject invent
  thou dost breathe pour'st verse,
  Thine sweet argument, excellent,
  vulgar paper rehearse?
  O give thy aught me,
  Worthy perusal stand thy sight,
  dumb write thee,
  thou thy dost give invention light?  
  thou tenth Muse, ten times worth
  rhymers invocate,
  calls thee, bring forth
  Eternal numbers outlive long date.
    slight muse curious days,
    pain mine, thine praise.


                     39
  O thy worth manners sing,
  thou art part me?
  mine praise mine bring:
  is't mine praise thee?
  this, divided live,
  dear love lose single one,
  separation give:
  due thee thou deserv'st alone:
  O absence torment wouldst thou prove,
  thy sour leisure gave sweet leave,
  entertain time thoughts love,
  time thoughts sweetly doth deceive.  
    thou teachest make twain,
    praising doth remain.


                     40
  loves, love, yea all,
  hast thou thou hadst before?
  love, love, thou mayst true love call,
  mine thine, thou hadst more:
  love, thou love receivest,
  blame thee, love thou usest,
  blamed, thou thy deceivest
  wilful taste thy refusest.
  forgive thy robbery gentle thief
  thou steal thee poverty:
  love greater grief
  bear greater wrong, hate's injury.
    Lascivious grace, ill shows,
    Kill spites foes.


                     41  
  pretty wrongs liberty commits,
  absent thy heart,
  Thy beauty, thy years full befits,
  temptation thou art.
  Gentle thou art, won,
  Beauteous thou art, assailed.
  woman woos, woman's son,
  sourly leave till prevailed?
  Ay me, thou mightst seat forbear,
  chide thy beauty, thy straying youth,
  lead thee riot there
  thou art forced break twofold truth:
    thy beauty tempting thee,
    Thine thy beauty false me.


                     42
  thou hast grief,
  loved dearly,
  hath thee wailing chief,
  loss love touches nearly.  
  Loving offenders excuse ye,
  Thou dost love her, thou know'st love her,
  sake doth abuse me,
  Suff'ring friend sake approve her.
  lose thee, loss love's gain,
  losing her, friend hath found loss,
  find other, lose twain,
  sake lay cross,
    joy, friend one,
    Sweet flattery, loves alone.


                     43
  wink mine eyes see,
  day view things unrespected,
  sleep, dreams thee,
  darkly bright, bright dark directed.
  thou shadow shadows doth make bright
  thy shadow's form, form happy show,
  clear day thy clearer light,
  unseeing eyes thy shade shines so!  
  (I say) mine eyes blessed made,
  thee living day,
  dead night thy fair imperfect shade,
  heavy sleep sightless eyes doth stay!
    days nights till thee,
    nights bright days dreams show thee me.


                     44
  dull substance flesh thought,
  Injurious distance stop way,
  space brought,
  limits remote, thou dost stay,
  matter foot stand
  farthest earth removed thee,
  nimble thought jump sea land,
  place be.
  ah, thought kills thought
  leap large lengths miles thou art gone,
  earth water wrought,
  attend, time's leisure moan.  
    Receiving nought elements slow,
    heavy tears, badges either's woe.


                     45
  two, slight air, purging fire,
  thee, abide,
  thought, desire,
  present-absent swift motion slide.
  quicker elements gone
  tender embassy love thee,
  life made four, alone,
  Sinks death, oppressed melancholy.
  life's composition recured,
  swift messengers returned thee,
  back assured,
  thy fair health, recounting me.
    told, joy, longer glad,
    send back straight grow sad.


                     46  
  Mine eye heart mortal war,
  divide conquest thy sight,
  Mine eye, heart thy picture's sight bar,
  heart, mine eye freedom right,
  heart doth plead thou dost lie,
  (A closet pierced crystal eyes)
  defendant doth plea deny,
  thy fair appearance lies.
  side title impanelled
  quest thoughts, tenants heart,
  verdict determined
  clear eye's moiety, dear heart's part.
    thus, mine eye's due thy outward part,
    heart's right, thy love heart.


                     47
  Betwixt mine eye heart league took,
  doth good turns other,
  mine eye famished look,
  heart love sighs doth smother;  
  love's picture eye doth feast,
  painted banquet bids heart:
  time mine eye heart's guest,
  thoughts love doth share part.
  thy picture love,
  Thy away, art present me,
  thou farther thoughts canst move,
  them, thee.
    sleep, thy picture sight
    Awakes heart, heart's eye's delight.


                     48
  careful way,
  trifle truest bars thrust,
  unused stay
  hands falsehood, wards trust!
  thou, jewels trifles are,
  worthy comfort, greatest grief,
  Thou dearest, mine care,
  Art left prey vulgar thief.  
  Thee locked chest,
  Save thou art not, feel thou art,
  gentle closure breast,
  pleasure thou mayst part,
    thou wilt stol'n fear,
    truth proves thievish prize dear.


                     49
  time (if time come)
  thee frown defects,
  thy love hath cast utmost sum,
  Called audit advised respects,
  time thou shalt strangely pass,
  scarcely greet sun thine eye,
  love converted thing was
  reasons find settled gravity;
  time ensconce here
  knowledge mine desert,
  hand, uprear,
  guard lawful reasons thy part,  
    leave poor me, thou hast strength laws,
    love, allege cause.


                     50
  heavy journey way,
  seek (my weary travel's end)
  Doth teach case repose say
  'Thus miles measured thy friend.'
  beast bears me, tired woe,
  Plods dully on, bear weight me,
  instinct wretch know
  rider loved speed made thee:
  bloody spur provoke on,
  anger thrusts hide,
  heavily answers groan,
  sharp spurring side,
    groan doth put mind,
    grief lies onward joy behind.


                     51  
  love excuse slow offence,
  dull bearer, thee speed,
  thou art, haste thence?
  Till return posting need.
  O excuse poor beast find,
  swift extremity slow?
  spur mounted wind,
  winged speed motion know,
  horse desire pace,
  desire (of perfect'st love made)
  neigh (no dull flesh) fiery race,
  love, love, excuse jade,
    thee going, wilful-slow,
    thee run, give leave go.

  Describe Adonis counterfeit,

  Helen's cheek art beauty set,
  Grecian tires painted new:  
  Speak spring, foison year,

  O doth beauty beauteous seem,
  sweet ornament truth doth give!
  rose fair, fairer deem
  sweet odour, doth live:
  canker blooms full deep dye,
  perfumed tincture roses,
  Hang thorns, play wantonly,
  summer's breath masked buds discloses:
  virtue show,
  live unwooed, unrespected fade,
  Die themselves. Sweet roses so,
  sweet deaths, sweetest odours made:  
    you, beauteous lovely youth,
    vade, verse distills truth.


                     55

  To-morrow sharpened might.

  Thy hungry eyes, till wink fulness,
  To-morrow again, kill

  love now
  Time's injurious hand crushed o'erworn,
  hours drained blood filled brow
  lines wrinkles, youthful morn
  Hath travelled age's steepy night,
  beauties whereof king
  vanishing, vanished sight,
  Stealing treasure spring:  
  time fortify
  confounding age's cruel knife,

  sweet love's beauty, lover's life.
    beauty black lines seen,
    live, green.


                     64
  Time's fell hand defaced
  rich-proud cost outworn buried age,
  lofty towers down-rased,

  hungry ocean gain
  Advantage kingdom shore,

  Increasing store loss, loss store.

  O summer's honey breath hold out,

  O fearful meditation, alack,
  Time's jewel Time's chest lie hid?

  Tired restful death cry,
  behold desert beggar born,
  needy trimmed jollity,
  purest faith unhappily forsworn,
  gilded honour shamefully misplaced,
  maiden virtue rudely strumpeted,
  perfection wrongfully disgraced,
  strength limping sway disabled
  art made tongue-tied authority,
  folly (doctor-like) controlling skill,
  simple truth miscalled simplicity,
  captive good attending captain ill.
    Tired these, gone,
    Save die, leave love alone.


                     67
  Ah wherefore infection live,
  presence grace impiety,
  sin advantage achieve,
  lace society?  
  false painting imitate cheek,
  steal dead living hue?
  poor beauty indirectly seek,
  Roses shadow, rose true?
  live, nature bankrupt is,
  Beggared blood blush lively veins,
  hath exchequer his,
  proud many, lives gains?
    O stores, show wealth had,
    days long since, bad.

  Ere beauty's dead fleece made gay:  
  holy antique hours seen,
  ornament, true,
  Making summer another's green,
  Robbing dress beauty new,
    map doth Nature store,
    show false Art beauty yore.


                     69
  parts thee world's eye doth view,

  Uttering bare truth, foes commend.
  Thy outward outward praise crowned,
  tongues give thee thine own,
  accents praise confound
  farther eye hath shown.
  beauty thy mind,

  churls thoughts (although eyes kind)
  thy fair flower add rank smell weeds:  
    thy odour matcheth thy show,
    soil this, thou dost common grow.


                     70
  thou art blamed thy defect,
  slander's mark fair,

  crow flies heaven's sweetest air.
  thou good, slander doth approve,
  Thy worth greater wooed time,
  canker vice sweetest buds doth love,
  thou present'st pure unstained prime.
  Thou hast passed ambush young days,
  assailed, victor charged,
  thy praise thy praise,
  tie envy, evermore enlarged,
    suspect ill masked thy show,
    thou kingdoms hearts shouldst owe.

  Give warning world fled

  O true love false this,

  live shame me, you.
    shamed bring forth,
    you, love things worth.


                     73
  time year thou mayst behold,
  yellow leaves, none, hang
  boughs shake cold,
  Bare ruined choirs, late sweet birds sang.
  thou seest twilight day,
  sunset fadeth west,
  black night doth away,
  Death's seals rest.  
  thou seest glowing fire,
  ashes youth doth lie,
  death-bed, whereon expire,
  Consumed nourished by.
    thou perceiv'st, makes thy love strong,
    love well, thou leave ere long.


                     74
  contented fell arrest,

  thou reviewest this, thou dost review,
  part consecrate thee,
  earth earth, due,

  thou hast lost dregs life,
  prey worms, body dead,
  coward conquest wretch's knife,
  base thee remembered,  
    worth that, contains,
    this, thee remains.


                     75

  'twixt miser wealth found.
  proud enjoyer, anon
  Doubting filching age steal treasure,

  Possessing pursuing delight
  Save had, took.
    pine surfeit day day,
    gluttoning all, away.


                     76  
  verse barren pride?
  variation quick change?
  time glance aside
  new-found methods, compounds strange?
  write one, same,
  invention noted weed,
  word doth name,
  Showing birth, proceed?
  O sweet love write you,
  love argument:
  dressing words new,
  Spending spent:
    sun daily old,
    love telling told.


                     77
  Thy glass show thee thy beauties wear,
  Thy dial thy precious minutes waste,
  vacant leaves thy mind's imprint bear,
  book, learning mayst thou taste.  
  wrinkles thy glass show,
  mouthed graves give thee memory,
  Thou thy dial's shady stealth mayst know,
  Time's thievish progress eternity.
  thy memory contain,
  Commit waste blanks, thou shalt find
  children nursed, delivered thy brain,

    offices, oft thou wilt look,
    profit thee, enrich thy book.

  others' works thou dost mend style,

    thou art art, dost advance
    high learning, rude ignorance.

  Whilst call thy aid,
  verse thy gentle grace,
  gracious numbers decayed,
  sick muse doth give place.

  Deserves travail worthier pen,

  Thou fair, wert sympathized,
  true plain words, thy true-telling friend.
    gross painting used,
    cheeks blood, thee abused.


                     83
  painting need,
  fair painting set,

  barren tender poet's debt:
  slept report,
  extant show,
  modern quill doth short,
  Speaking worth, worth doth grow.  
  silence sin impute,
  glory dumb,
  impair beauty mute,
  give life, bring tomb.
    lives life fair eyes,
    poets praise devise.


                     84
  most, more,

  confine immured store,

  Lean penury pen doth dwell,

  Making style admired where.  
    beauteous blessings add curse,
    fond praise, makes praises worse.


                     85
  tongue-tied muse manners holds still,
  comments praise richly compiled,
  Reserve character golden quill,
  precious phrase Muses filed.
  good thoughts, whilst write good words,

  No, he, compeers night
  Giving aid, verse astonished.
  affable familiar ghost
  nightly gulls intelligence,

                     87
  Farewell! thou art dear possessing,
  thou know'st thy estimate,
  charter thy worth thee releasing:
  bonds thee determinate.  
  hold thee thy granting,
  riches deserving?
  fair gift wanting,
  patent back swerving.
  Thy thou gav'st, thy worth knowing,
  thou gav'st it, mistaking,
  thy great gift misprision growing,
  home again, judgement making.
    thee dream doth flatter,
    sleep king, waking matter.


                     88
  thou shalt disposed set light,
  place merit eye scorn,
  thy side, fight,
  prove thee virtuous, thou art forsworn:
  mine weakness acquainted,
  thy part set story
  faults concealed, attainted:
  thou losing me, shalt win glory:  
  gainer too,
  bending loving thoughts thee,
  injuries do,
  thee vantage, double-vantage me.
    love, thee belong,
    thy right, bear wrong.


                     89
  thou didst forsake fault,
  comment offence,
  Speak lameness, straight halt:
  thy reasons making defence.
  Thou canst (love) disgrace half ill,
  set form desired change,
  disgrace, knowing thy will,
  acquaintance strangle strange:
  absent thy walks tongue,
  Thy sweet beloved dwell,
  (too profane) wronk:
  haply acquaintance tell.  
    thee, vow debate,
    ne'er love thou dost hate.


                     90
  hate thou wilt, ever, now,
  world bent deeds cross,
  join spite fortune, make bow,
  drop after-loss:
  Ah not, heart hath 'scaped sorrow,
  rearward conquered woe,
  Give windy night rainy morrow,
  linger purposed overthrow.
  thou wilt leave me, leave last,
  petty griefs spite,
  onset come, taste
  worst fortune's might.
    strains woe, woe,
    Compared loss thee, so.


                     91  
  glory birth, skill,
  wealth, body's force,
  garments new-fangled ill:
  hawks hounds, horse.
  humour hath adjunct pleasure,
  finds joy rest,
  particulars measure,
  general best.
  Thy love high birth me,
  Richer wealth, prouder garments' costs,
  delight hawks horses be:
  thee, men's pride boast.
    Wretched alone, thou mayst take,
    away, wretchcd make.


                     92
  thy worst steal thy away,
  term life thou art assured mine,
  life longer thy love stay,
  depends love thine.  
  fear worst wrongs,
  life hath end,
  see, state belongs
  that, thy humour doth depend.
  Thou canst vex inconstant mind,
  life thy revolt doth lie,
  O happy title find,
  Happy thy love, happy die!
    blessed-fair fears blot?
    Thou mayst false, not.


                     93

  deceived husband, love's face,

  Thy me, thy heart place.

  writ moods frowns wrinkles strange.

  thy face sweet love dwell,
  Whate'er thy thoughts, thy heart's workings be,
  Thy thence, sweetness tell.
    Eve's apple doth thy beauty grow,
    thy sweet virtue answer thy show.


                     94
  power hurt, none,
  thing, show,
  moving others, stone,
  Unmoved, cold, temptation slow:
  rightly inherit heaven's graces,
  husband nature's riches expense,
  Tibey lords owners faces,
  Others, stewards excellence:
  summer's flower summer sweet,
  self, live die,
  flower base infection meet,
  basest weed outbraves dignity:  
    sweetest things turn sourest deeds,
    Lilies fester, smell worse weeds.


                     95
  sweet lovely dost thou make shame,
  canker fragrant rose,
  Doth spot beauty thy budding name!
  O sweets dost thou thy sins enclose!
  tongue tells story thy days,
  (Making lascivious comments thy sport)
  dispraise, kind praise,
  Naming thy name, blesses ill report.
  O mansion vices got,
  habitation chose thee,
  beauty's veil doth cover blot,
  things turns fair, eyes see!
    heed (dear heart) large privilege,
    hardest knife ill-used doth lose edge.


                     96  
  thy fault youth, wantonness,
  thy grace youth gentle sport,
  grace faults loved less:
  Thou mak'st faults graces, thee resort:
  finger throned queen,
  basest jewel esteemed:
  errors thee seen,
  truths translated, true things deemed.
  lambs stern wolf betray,
  lamb translate!
  gazers mightst thou lead away,
  thou wouldst strength thy state!
    so, love thee sort,
    thou mine, mine thy good report.


                     97
  winter hath absence been
  thee, pleasure fleeting year!
  freezings felt, dark days seen!
  December's bareness everywhere!  
  time removed summer's time,
  teeming autumn big rich increase,
  Bearing wanton burden prime,
  widowed wombs lords' decease:
  abundant issue me
  hope orphans, unfathered fruit,
  summer pleasures wait thee,
  thou away, birds mute.
    sing, 'tis dull cheer,
    leaves pale, dreading winter's near.


                     98
  absent spring,
  proud-pied April (dressed trim)
  Hath put spirit youth thing:
  heavy Saturn laughed leaped him.
  lays birds, sweet smell
  flowers odour hue,
  make summer's story tell:
  proud lap pluck grew:  
  lily's white,
  praise deep vermilion rose,
  sweet, figures delight:
  Drawn you, pattern those.
    winter still, away,
    shadow play.


                     99
  forward violet chide,
  Sweet thief, didst thou steal thy sweet smells,
  love's breath? purple pride
  thy soft check complexion dwells,
  love's veins thou hast grossly dyed.
  lily condemned thy hand,
  buds marjoram stol'n thy hair,
  roses fearfully thorns stand,
  blushing shame, white despair:
  red, white, stol'n both,
  robbery annexed thy breath,
  theft pride growth  
  vengeful canker eat death.
    flowers noted, see,
    sweet, colour stol'n thee.


                     100
  art thou Muse thou forget'st long,
  speak thee thy might?
  Spend'st thou thy fury worthless song,
  Darkening thy power lend base subjects light?
  Return forgetful Muse, straight redeem,
  gentle numbers time idly spent,
  Sing ear doth thy lays esteem,
  thy pen skill argument.
  Rise resty Muse, love's sweet face survey,
  time wrinkle graven there,
  any, satire decay,
  make time's spoils despised everywhere.
    Give love fame faster Time wastes life,
    thou prevent'st scythe, crooked knife.

  
                     101
  O truant Muse thy amends,
  thy neglect truth beauty dyed?
  truth beauty love depends:
  dost thou too, dignified:
  Make answer Muse, wilt thou haply say,
  'Truth colour colour fixed,
  Beauty pencil, beauty's truth lay:
  best, intermixed'?
  praise, wilt thou dumb?
  Excuse silence so, for't lies thee,
  make outlive gilded tomb:
  praised ages be.
    thy office Muse, teach thee how,
    make long hence, shows now.


                     102
  love strengthened weak seeming,
  love less, show appear,
  love merchandized, rich esteeming,  
  owner's tongue doth publish where.
  love new, spring,
  wont greet lays,
  Philomel summer's front doth sing,
  stops pipe growth riper days:
  summer pleasant now
  mournful hymns hush night,
  wild music burthens bough,
  sweets grown common lose dear delight.
    her, hold tongue:
    dull song.


                     103
  Alack poverty muse brings forth,
  scope show pride,
  argument bare worth
  hath added praise beside.
  O blame write!
  glass appears face,
  over-goes blunt invention quite,  
  Dulling lines, disgrace.
  sinful striving mend,
  mar subject well?
  pass verses tend,
  graces gifts tell.
    more, verse sit,
    glass shows you, it.


                     104
  fair friend old,
  eye eyed,
  beauty still: winters cold,
  forests shook summers' pride,
  beauteous springs yellow autumn turned,
  process seasons seen,
  April perfumes hot Junes burned,
  fresh green.
  Ah doth beauty dial hand,
  Steal figure, pace perceived,
  sweet hue, methinks doth stand  
  Hath motion, mine eye deceived.
    fear which, hear thou age unbred,
    Ere born beauty's summer dead.


                     105
  love called idolatry,
  beloved idol show,
  alike songs praises be
  one, one, such, so.
  Kind love to-day, to-morrow kind,
  constant wondrous excellence,
  verse constancy confined,
  thing expressing, leaves difference.
  Fair, kind, true, argument,
  Fair, kind, true, varying words,
  change invention spent,
  themes one, wondrous scope affords.
    Fair, kind, true, lived alone.
    till now, seat one.

  
                     106
  chronicle wasted time,
  descriptions fairest wights,
  beauty making beautiful rhyme,
  praise ladies dead, lovely knights,
  blazon sweet beauty's best,
  hand, foot, lip, eye, brow,
  antique pen expressed,
  beauty master now.
  praises prophecies
  time, prefiguring,
  looked divining eyes,
  skill worth sing:
    behold present days,
    eyes wonder, lack tongues praise.


                     107
  mine fears, prophetic soul,
  wide world, dreaming things come,
  lease true love control,  
  Supposed forfeit confined doom.
  mortal moon hath eclipse endured,
  sad augurs mock presage,
  Incertainties crown assured,
  peace proclaims olives endless age.
  drops balmy time,
  love fresh, death subscribes,
  spite live poor rhyme,
  insults o'er dull speechless tribes.
    thou shalt find thy monument,
    tyrants' crests tombs brass spent.


                     108
  brain ink character,
  hath figured thee true spirit,
  speak, register,
  express love, thy dear merit?
  sweet boy, prayers divine,
  day o'er same,
  Counting thing old, thou mine, thine,  
  hallowed thy fair name.
  eternal love love's fresh case,
  Weighs dust injury age,
  wrinkles place,
  makes antiquity aye page,
    Finding conceit love bred,
    time outward form show dead.


                     109
  O false heart,
  absence flame qualify,
  easy depart,
  soul thy breast doth lie:
  home love, ranged,
  travels return again,
  time, time exchanged,
  bring water stain,
  nature reigned,
  frailties besiege kinds blood,
  preposterously stained,  
  leave thy sum good:
    wide universe call,
    Save thou rose, thou art all.


                     110
  Alas 'tis true, there,
  made motley view,
  Gored mine thoughts, sold cheap dear,
  Made offences affections new.
  true is, looked truth
  Askance strangely: above,
  blenches gave heart youth,
  worse essays proved thee love.
  done, end,
  Mine appetite grind
  newer proof, older friend,
  god love, confined.
    give welcome, heaven best,
    thy pure loving breast.

  
                     111
  O sake Fortune chide,
  guilty goddess harmful deeds,
  life provide,
  public means public manners breeds.
  receives brand,
  nature subdued
  works in, dyer's hand:
  Pity then, renewed,
  Whilst patient drink,
  Potions eisel 'gainst strong infection,
  bitterness bitter think,
  double penance correct correction.
    Pity dear friend, assure ye,
    pity cure me.


                     112
  love pity doth th' impression fill,
  vulgar scandal stamped brow,
  care calls ill,  
  o'er-green bad, good allow?
  world, strive,
  shames praises tongue,
  me, alive,
  steeled sense wrong.
  profound abysm throw care
  others' voices, adder's sense,
  critic flatterer stopped are:
  Mark neglect dispense.
    strongly purpose bred,
    world methinks dead.


                     113
  left you, mine eye mind,
  governs about,
  Doth part function, partly blind,
  seeing, effectually out:
  form delivers heart
  bird, flower, shape doth latch,
  quick objects hath mind part,  
  vision holds doth catch:
  rud'st gentlest sight,
  sweet favour deformed'st creature,
  mountain, sea, day, night:
  crow, dove, shapes feature.
    Incapable more, replete you,
    true mind maketh mine untrue.


                     114
  doth mind crowned you
  Drink monarch's plague flattery?
  mine eye saith true,
  love taught alchemy?
  make monsters, things indigest,
  cherubins sweet resemble,
  Creating bad perfect best
  fast objects beams assemble:
  O 'tis first, 'tis flattery seeing,
  great mind kingly drinks up,
  Mine eye gust 'greeing,  
  palate doth prepare cup.
    poisoned, 'tis lesser sin,
    mine eye loves doth begin.


                     115
  lines writ lie,
  love dearer,
  judgment knew reason why,
  full flame burn clearer,
  reckoning time, millioned accidents
  Creep 'twixt vows, change decrees kings,
  Tan sacred beauty, blunt sharp'st intents,
  Divert strong minds alt'ring things:
  Alas fearing time's tyranny,
  'Now love best,'
  o'er incertainty,
  Crowning present, doubting rest?
    Love babe, so
    give full growth doth grow.

  
                     116
  marriage true minds
  Admit impediments, love love
  alters alteration finds,
  bends remover remove.
  O no, ever-fixed mark
  tempests shaken;
  star wand'ring bark,
  worth's unknown, height taken.
  Love's Time's fool, rosy lips cheeks
  bending sickle's compass come,
  Love alters hours weeks,
  bears edge doom:
    error proved,
    writ, man loved.


                     117
  Accuse thus, scanted all,
  great deserts repay,
  Forgot dearest love call,  
  Whereto bonds tie day day,
  frequent unknown minds,
  time dear-purchased right,
  hoisted sail winds
  transport farthest sight.
  Book wilfulness errors down,
  proof surmise, accumulate,
  Bring level frown,
  shoot wakened hate:
    appeal strive prove
    constancy virtue love.


                     118
  make appetite keen
  eager compounds palate urge,
  prevent maladies unseen,
  sicken shun sickness purge.
  full ne'er-cloying sweetness,
  bitter sauces frame feeding;
  sick welfare found kind meetness,  
  diseased ere true needing.
  policy love t' anticipate
  ills not, grew faults assured,
  brought medicine healthful state
  rank goodness ill cured.
    learn find lesson true,
    Drugs poison feil sick you.


                     119
  potions drunk Siren tears
  Distilled limbecks foul hell within,
  Applying fears hopes, hopes fears,
  losing win!
  wretched errors hath heart committed,
  Whilst hath thought blessed never!
  mine eyes spheres fitted
  distraction madding fever!
  O benefit ill, find true
  is, evil made better.
  ruined love built anew  
  Grows fairer first, strong, greater.
    return rebuked content,
    gain ills thrice spent.


                     120
  unkind befriends now,
  sorrow, feel,
  transgression bow,
  nerves brass hammered steel.
  unkindness shaken
  yours, y'have passed hell time,
  tyrant leisure taken
  weigh suffered crime.
  O night woe remembered
  deepest sense, hard true sorrow hits,
  you, tendered
  humble salve, wounded bosoms fits!
    trespass fee,
    Mine ransoms yours, ransom me.

  
                     121
  'Tis vile vile esteemed,
  be, receives reproach being,
  pleasure lost, deemed,
  feeling, others' seeing.
  others' false adulterate eyes
  Give salutation sportive blood?
  frailties frailer spies,
  wills count bad good?
  No, am, level
  abuses, reckon own,
  straight bevel;
  rank thoughts, deeds shown
    general evil maintain,
    men bad badness reign.


                     122
  Thy gift, thy tables, brain
  Full charactered lasting memory,
  idle rank remain  
  date eternity.
  least, long brain heart
  faculty nature subsist,
  Till razed oblivion yield part
  thee, thy record missed:
  poor retention hold,
  tallies thy dear love score,
  give bold,
  trust tables receive thee more:
    adjunct remember thee
    import forgetfulness me.


                     123
  No! Time, thou shalt boast change,
  Thy pyramids built newer might
  novel, strange,
  dressings sight:
  dates brief, admire,
  thou dost foist old,
  make born desire,  
  heard told:
  Thy registers thee defy,
  wond'ring present, past,
  thy records, doth lie,
  Made thy continual haste:
    vow be,
    true thy scythe thee.


                     124
  dear love child state,
  Fortune's bastard unfathered,
  subject time's love time's hate,
  Weeds weeds, flowers flowers gathered.
  builded accident,
  suffers smiling pomp, falls
  blow thralled discontent,
  Whereto th' inviting time fashion calls:
  fears policy heretic,
  works leases short-numbered hours,
  stands hugely politic,  
  grows heat, drowns showers.
    witness call fools time,
    die goodness, lived crime.


                     125
  Were't aught bore canopy,
  extern outward honouring,
  laid great bases eternity,
  proves short waste ruining?
  dwellers form favour
  Lose all, paying rent
  compound sweet; forgoing simple savour,
  Pitiful thrivers gazing spent?
  No, obsequious thy heart,
  thou oblation, poor free,
  mixed seconds, art,
  mutual render, thee.
    Hence, thou suborned informer, true soul
    impeached, stands thy control.

  
                     126
  O thou lovely boy thy power,
  Dost hold Time's fickle glass fickle hour:
  hast waning grown, show'st,
  Thy lovers withering, thy sweet grow'st.
  Nature (sovereign mistress wrack)
  thou goest onwards pluck thee back,
  thee purpose, skill
  time disgrace, wretched minutes kill.
  fear O thou minion pleasure,
  detain, treasure!
    audit (though delayed) answered be,
    quietus render thee.


                     127
  age black counted fair,
  bore beauty's name:
  black beauty's successive heir,
  beauty slandered bastard shame,
  hand hath put nature's power,  
  Fairing foul art's false borrowed face,
  Sweet beauty hath holy bower,
  profaned, lives disgrace.
  mistress' eyes raven black,
  eyes suited, mourners seem,
  born fair beauty lack,
  Slandering creation false esteem,
    mourn woe,
    tongue beauty so.


                     128
  oft thou, music, music play'st,
  blessed wood motion sounds
  thy sweet fingers thou gently sway'st
  wiry concord mine ear confounds,
  envy jacks nimble leap,
  kiss tender thy hand,
  Whilst poor lips harvest reap,
  wood's boldness thee blushing stand.
  tickled change state  
  situation dancing chips,
  O'er thy fingers walk gentle gait,
  Making dead wood blest living lips,
    saucy jacks happy this,
    Give thy fingers, thy lips kiss.


                     129
  Th' expense spirit waste shame
  lust action, till action, lust
  perjured, murd'rous, bloody full blame,
  Savage, extreme, rude, cruel, trust,
  Enjoyed sooner despised straight,
  Past reason hunted, sooner had
  Past reason hated swallowed bait,
  purpose laid make taker mad.
  Mad pursuit possession so,
  Had, having, quest, extreme,
  bliss proof proved, woe,
  joy proposed dream.
    world well,  
    shun heaven leads men hell.


                     130
  mistress' eyes sun,
  Coral red, lips red,
  snow white, breasts dun:
  hairs wires, black wires grow head:
  roses damasked, red white,
  roses cheeks,
  perfumes delight,
  breath mistress reeks.
  love hear speak, know,
  music hath pleasing sound:
  grant goddess go,
  mistress walks treads ground.
    heaven love rare,
    belied false compare.


                     131
  Thou art tyrannous, thou art,  
  beauties proudly make cruel;
  thou know'st dear doting heart
  Thou art fairest precious jewel.
  good faith thee behold,
  Thy face hath power make love groan;
  err, dare bold,
  swear alone.
  false swear,
  thousand groans thinking thy face,
  another's neck witness bear
  Thy black fairest judgment's place.
    art thou black save thy deeds,
    slander proceeds.


                     132
  Thine eyes love, pitying me,
  Knowing thy heart torment disdain,
  put black, loving mourners be,
  pretty ruth pain.
  morning sun heaven  
  grey cheeks east,
  full star ushers even
  Doth half glory sober west
  mourning eyes thy face:
  O beseem thy heart
  mourn mourning doth thee grace,
  suit thy pity part.
    swear beauty black,
    foul thy complexion lack.


                     133
  Beshrew heart makes heart groan
  deep wound friend me;
  Is't torture alone,
  slave slavery sweet'st friend be?
  thy cruel eye hath taken,
  thou harder hast engrossed,
  him, self, thee forsaken,
  torment thrice three-fold crossed:
  Prison heart thy steel bosom's ward,  
  friend's heart poor heart bail,
  Whoe'er me, heart guard,
  Thou canst rigour gaol.
    thou wilt, pent thee,
    Perforce thine me.


                     134
  confessed thine,
  mortgaged thy will,
  forfeit, mine,
  Thou wilt restore comfort still:
  thou wilt not, free,
  thou art covetous, kind,
  learned surety-like write me,
  bond fist doth bind.
  statute thy beauty thou wilt take,
  Thou usurer put'st use,
  sue friend, debtor sake,
  lose unkind abuse.
    lost, thou hast me,  
    pays whole, free.


                     135
  hath wish, thou hast thy will,
  'Will' boot, 'Will' over-plus,
  vex thee still,
  thy sweet making addition thus.
  Wilt thou large spacious,
  vouchsafe hide thine?
  gracious,
  fair acceptance shine?
  sea water, receives rain still,
  abundance addeth store,
  thou rich add thy will
  mine make thy large more.
    unkind, fair beseechers kill,
    one, 'Will.'


                     136
  thy soul check thee near,  
  Swear thy blind soul thy 'Will',
  thy soul admitted there,
  love, love-suit sweet fulfil.
  'Will', fulfil treasure thy love,
  Ay, fill full wills, one,
  things great receipt case prove,
  number reckoned none.
  number pass untold,
  thy store's account be,
  hold me, thee hold,
  me, sweet thee.
    Make thy love, love still,
    thou lov'st Will.


                     137
  Thou blind fool Love, dost thou mine eyes,
  behold see?
  beauty is, lies,
  is, worst be.
  eyes corrupt over-partial looks,  
  anchored bay men ride,
  eyes' falsehood hast thou forged hooks,
  Whereto judgment heart tied?
  heart plot,
  heart wide world's common place?
  mine eyes this, not
  put fair truth foul face?
    things true heart eyes erred,
    false plague transferred.


                     138
  love swears made truth,
  lies,
  untutored youth,
  Unlearned world's false subtleties.
  vainly thinking thinks young,
  days past best,
  Simply credit false-speaking tongue,
  sides simple truth suppressed:
  wherefore unjust?  
  wherefore old?
  O love's habit trust,
  age love, loves years told.
    lie her, me,
    faults lies flattered be.


                     139
  O call justify wrong,
  thy unkindness lays heart,
  Wound thine eye thy tongue,
  power power, slay art,
  thou lov'st elsewhere; sight,
  Dear heart forbear glance thine eye aside,
  need'st thou wound cunning thy might
  o'erpressed defence bide?
  excuse thee, ah love knows,
  pretty mine enemies,
  face turns foes,
  dart injuries:
    so, slain,  
    Kill outright looks, rid pain.


                     140
  wise thou art cruel, press
  tongue-tied patience disdain:
  sorrow lend words words express,
  manner pity-wanting pain.
  teach thee wit were,
  love, love so,
  testy sick men deaths near,
  news health physicians know.
  despair grow mad,
  madness speak ill thee,
  ill-wresting world grown bad,
  Mad slanderers mad ears believed be.
    so, thou belied,
    Bear thine eyes straight, thy proud heart wide.


                     141
  faith love thee mine eyes,  
  thee thousand errors note,
  'tis heart loves despise,
  view pleased dote.
  mine cars thy tongue's tune delighted,
  tender feeling base touches prone,
  taste, smell, desire invited
  sensual feast thee alone:
  wits, senses can
  Dissuade foolish heart serving thee,
  leaves unswayed likeness man,
  Thy proud heart's slave vassal wretch be:
    plague count gain,
    makes sin, awards pain.


                     142
  Love sin, thy dear virtue hate,
  Hate sin, grounded sinful loving,
  O mine, compare thou thine state,
  thou shalt find merits reproving,
  do, lips thine,  
  profaned scarlet ornaments,
  sealed false bonds love oft mine,
  Robbed others' beds' revenues rents.
  lawful love thee thou lov'st those,
  thine eyes woo mine importune thee,
  Root pity thy heart grows,
  Thy pity deserve pitied be.
    thou dost seek thou dost hide,
    self-example mayst thou denied.


                     143
  Lo careful huswife runs catch,
  feathered creatures broke away,
  Sets babe makes swift dispatch
  pursuit thing stay:
  Whilst neglected child holds chase,
  Cries catch busy care bent,
  follow flies face:
  prizing poor infant's discontent;
  run'st thou flies thee,  
  Whilst thy babe chase thee afar behind,
  thou catch thy hope turn back me:
  play mother's part, kiss me, kind.
    pray thou mayst thy Will,
    thou turn back loud crying still.


                     144
  loves comfort despair,
  spirits suggest still,
  angel man fair:
  worser spirit woman coloured ill.
  win hell female evil,
  Tempteth angel side,
  corrupt saint devil:
  Wooing purity foul pride.
  angel turned fiend,
  Suspect may, directly tell,
  friend,
  guess angel another's hell.
    ne'er live doubt,  
    Till bad angel fire good out.


                     145
  lips Love's hand make,
  Breathed sound 'I hate',
  languished sake:
  woeful state,
  Straight heart mercy come,
  Chiding tongue sweet,
  giving gentle doom:
  taught anew greet:
  'I hate' altered end,
  gentle day,
  Doth follow night fiend
  heaven hell flown away.
    'I hate', hate threw,
    saved life 'not you'.


                     146
  Poor soul centre sinful earth,  
  sinful earth rebel powers array,
  dost thou pine suffer dearth
  Painting thy outward walls costly gay?
  large cost short lease,
  Dost thou thy fading mansion spend?
  worms inheritors excess
  Eat thy charge? thy body's end?
  soul live thou thy servant's loss,
  pine aggravate thy store;
  Buy terms divine selling hours dross;
  fed, rich more,
    thou feed death, feeds men,
    death dead, dying then.


                     147
  love fever longing still,
  longer nurseth disease,
  Feeding doth preserve ill,
  Th' uncertain sickly appetite please:
  reason physician love,  
  Angry prescriptions kept
  Hath left me, desperate approve,
  Desire death, physic except.
  Past cure am, reason past care,
  frantic-mad evermore unrest,
  thoughts discourse mad men's are,
  random truth vainly expressed.
    sworn thee fair, thought thee bright,
    art black hell, dark night.


                     148
  O me! eyes hath love put head,
  correspondence true sight,
  have, judgment fled,
  censures falsely aright?
  fair whereon false eyes dote,
  means world so?
  not, love doth denote,
  Love's eye true men's: no,
  it? O love's eye true,  
  vexed watching tears?
  marvel mistake view,
  sun sees not, till heaven clears.
    O cunning love, tears thou keep'st blind,
    eyes well-seeing thy foul faults find.


                     149
  Canst thou O cruel, love thee not,
  thee partake?
  thee forgot
  self, all-tyrant, thy sake?
  hateth thee call friend,
  frown'st thou fawn upon,
  Nay thou lour'st spend
  Revenge present moan?
  merit respect,
  proud thy service despise,
  doth worship thy defect,
  Commanded motion thine eyes?
    love hate thy mind,  
    thou lov'st, blind.


                     150
  O power hast thou powerful might,
  insufficiency heart sway,
  make give lie true sight,
  swear brightness doth grace day?
  hast thou things ill,
  refuse thy deeds,
  strength warrantise skill,
  mind thy worst exceeds?
  taught thee make love thee more,
  hear hate?
  O love abhor,
  thou shouldst abhor state.
    thy unworthiness raised love me,
    worthy beloved thee.


                     151
  Love young conscience is,  
  conscience born love?
  gentle cheater urge amiss,
  guilty faults thy sweet prove.
  thou betraying me, betray
  nobler part gross body's treason,
  soul doth body may,
  Triumph love, flesh stays farther reason,
  rising thy doth point thee,
  triumphant prize, proud pride,
  contented thy poor drudge be,
  stand thy affairs, fall thy side.
    conscience hold call,
    love, dear love rise fall.


                     152
  loving thee thou know'st forsworn,
  thou art forsworn love swearing,
  act thy bed-vow broke faith torn,
  vowing hate love bearing:
  oaths' breach accuse thee,  
  break twenty? perjured most,
  vows oaths misuse thee:
  honest faith thee lost.
  sworn deep oaths thy deep kindness:
  Oaths thy love, thy truth, thy constancy,
  enlighten thee gave eyes blindness,
  made swear thing see.
    sworn thee fair: perjured I,
    swear truth foul be.


                     153
  Cupid laid brand fell asleep,
  maid Dian's advantage found,
  love-kindling fire quickly steep
  cold valley-fountain ground:
  borrowed holy fire Love,
  dateless lively heat endure,
  grew seeting bath men prove,
  strange maladies sovereign cure:
  mistress' eye Love's brand new-fired,  
  boy trial touch breast,
  sick withal bath desired,
  thither hied sad distempered guest.
    found cure, bath lies,
    Cupid fire; mistress' eyes.


                     154
  Love-god lying asleep,
  Laid side heart-inflaming brand,
  Whilst nymphs vowed chaste life keep,
  tripping by, maiden hand,
  fairest votary fire,
  legions true hearts warmed,
  general hot desire,
  sleeping virgin hand disarmed.
  brand quenched cool by,
  Love's fire heat perpetual,
  Growing bath healthful remedy,
  men discased, mistress' thrall,
    cure prove,  
    Love's fire heats water, water cools love.

    Sharp Buckingham unburdens tongue
    envious load lies heart;

    shining checker'd slough, doth sting child

    arm'd sworn do,
    Subscribe deep oaths, too.
  LONGAVILLE. resolv'd; 'tis years' fast.
    mind banquet, body pine.
    Fat paunches lean pates; dainty bits
    Make rich ribs, bankrupt wits.
  DUMAIN. loving lord, Dumain mortified.

Enter JOHN GAUNT, sick, DUKE YORK, etc.

  GAUNT. King come, breathe last
    wholesome counsel unstaid youth?
  YORK. Vex yourself, strive breath;
    vain counsel ear.
  GAUNT. O, tongues dying men
    Enforce attention deep harmony.
    words scarce, seldom spent vain;
    breathe truth breathe words -in pain.
    listen'd more
    youth ease taught glose;
    men's ends mark'd lives before.
    setting sun, music close,
    taste sweets, sweetest last,
    Writ remembrance things long past.
    Richard life's counsel hear,
    death's sad tale undeaf ear.
  YORK. No; stopp'd flattering sounds,  
    praises, taste wise fond,
    Lascivious metres, venom sound
    open ear youth doth listen;
    Report fashions proud Italy,
    manners tardy apish nation
    Limps base imitation.
    doth world thrust vanity-
    new, respect vile-
    quickly buzz'd ears?
    late counsel heard
    doth mutiny wit's regard.
    Direct choose.
    'Tis breath thou lack'st, breath wilt thou lose.
  GAUNT. Methinks prophet inspir'd,
    expiring foretell him:
    rash fierce blaze riot last,
    violent fires burn themselves;
    Small showers long, sudden storms short;
    tires betimes spurs fast betimes;
    eager feeding food doth choke feeder;  
    Light vanity, insatiate cormorant,
    Consuming means, preys itself.
    royal throne kings, scept'red isle,
    earth majesty, seat Mars,
    Eden, demi-paradise,

    nurse, teeming womb royal kings,
    Fear'd breed, famous birth,
    Renowned deeds home,
    Christian service true chivalry,
    sepulchre stubborn Jewry
    world's ransom, blessed Mary's Son;
    land dear souls, dear dear land,  
    Dear reputation world,
    leas'd out-I die pronouncing it-
    tenement pelting farm.
    England, bound triumphant sea,
    rocky shore beats back envious siege
    wat'ry Neptune, bound shame,
    inky blots rotten parchment bonds;
    England, wont conquer others,
    Hath made shameful conquest itself.
    Ah, scandal vanish life,
    happy ensuing death!

    plants, herbs, stones, true qualities;
    naught vile earth doth live  
    earth special good doth give;
    aught good but, strain'd fair use,
    Revolts true birth, stumbling abuse.
    Virtue turns vice, misapplied,
    vice sometime's action dignified.
    infant rind small flower
    Poison hath residence, medicine power;
    this, smelt, part cheers part;
    tasted, slays senses heart.
    opposed kings encamp still

    Lo, thy cheek stain doth sit

    e'er thou wast thyself, woes thine,
    Thou woes Rosaline.

    Scorn'dst brain's flow, droplets  
    niggard nature fall, rich conceit
    Taught thee make vast Neptune weep aye
    thy low grave, faults forgiven. Dead
    noble Timon, memory
    more. Bring city,
    olive, sword;
    Make war breed peace, make peace stint war, make each
    Prescribe other, other's leech.
    drums strike.                                 Exeunt

A LOVER'S COMPLAINT

by William Shakespeare



  hill concave womb reworded
  plaintful story sist'ring vale,
  spirits t'attend double voice accorded,
  laid list sad-tuned tale,
  Ere long espied fickle maid full pale,
  Tearing papers, breaking rings atwain,
  Storming world sorrow's wind rain.

  head platted hive straw,
  fortified visage sun,
  Whereon thought saw
  carcase beauty spent done.
  Time scythed youth begun,
  youth quit, spite heaven's fell rage
  beauty peeped lattice seared age.

  Oft heave napkin eyne,
  conceited characters,
  Laund'ring silken figures brine
  seasoned woe pelleted tears,
  reading contents bears;  
  shrieking undistinguished woe,
  clamours size, high low.

  levelled eyes carriage ride,
  batt'ry spheres intend;
  diverted poor balls tied
  th' orbed earth; extend
  view on; anon gazes lend
  place once, fixed,
  mind sight distractedly commixed.

  hair, loose tied formal plat,
  Proclaimed careless hand pride;
  some, untucked, descended sheaved hat,
  Hanging pale pined cheek beside;
  threaden fillet bide,
  And, true bondage, break thence,
  slackly braided loose negligence.

  thousand favours maund drew  
  amber, crystal, beaded jet,
  river threw,
  weeping margent set;
  usury applying wet wet,
  monarchs' hands lets bounty fall
  cries some, excess begs all.

  folded schedules one,
  perused, sighed, tore, gave flood;
  Cracked ring posied gold bone,
  Bidding find sepulchres mud;
  Found moe letters sadly penned blood,
  sleided silk feat affectedly
  Enswathed sealed curious secrecy.

  bathed fluxive eyes,
  kissed, 'gan tear;
  Cried, 'O false blood, thou register lies,
  unapproved witness dost thou bear!
  Ink black damned here!  
  said, top rage lines rents,
  Big discontents breaking contents.

  reverend man grazed cattle nigh,
  blusterer ruffle knew
  court, city, by
  swiftest hours observed flew,
  afflicted fancy fastly drew;
  And, privileged age, desires know
  grounds motives woe.

  slides grained bat,
  comely distant sits side;
  desires her, sat,
  grievance hearing divide.
  aught applied
  suffering ecstasy assuage,
  'Tis promised charity age.

  'Father,' says, 'though behold  
  injury blasting hour,
  judgement old:
  age, sorrow, hath power.
  spreading flower,
  Fresh myself, self-applied
  Love myself, love beside.

  'But woe me! early attended
  youthful suit- gain grace-
  O, nature's outwards commended
  maidens' eyes stuck face.
  Love lacked dwelling made place;
  fair parts abide,
  lodged newly deified.

  'His browny locks hang crooked curls;
  light occasion wind
  lips silken parcels hurls.
  sweet do, aptly find:
  eye enchant mind;  
  visage drawn
  largeness thinks Paradise sawn.

  'Small show man chin;
  phoenix began appear,
  unshorn velvet, termless skin,
  bare out-bragged web wear:
  showed visage cost dear;
  nice affections wavering stood doubt
  was, without.

  'His qualities beauteous form,
  maiden-tongued was, thereof free;
  men moved him, storm
  oft 'twixt April see,
  winds breathe sweet, unruly be.
  rudeness authorized youth
  livery falseness pride truth.

  'Well ride, men say,  
  "That horse mettle rider takes:
  Proud subjection, noble sway,
  rounds, bounds, course, stop makes!"
  controversy question takes
  horse deed,
  manage th' well-doing steed.

  'But quickly side verdict went:
  real habitude gave life grace
  appertainings ornament,
  Accomplished himself, case,
  aids, made fairer place,
  additions; purposed trim
  Pierced grace, graced him.

  'So tip subduing tongue
  kind arguments question deep,
  replication prompt, reason strong,
  advantage wake sleep.
  make weeper laugh, laugher weep,  
  dialect skill,
  Catching passions craft will,

  'That general bosom reign
  young, old, sexes enchanted,
  dwell thoughts, remain
  personal duty, haunted.
  Consents bewitched, ere desire, granted,
  dialogued say,
  Asked wills, made wills obey.

  'Many picture get,
  serve eyes, put mind;
  fools th' imagination set
  goodly objects abroad find
  lands mansions, thought assigned;
  labouring moe pleasures bestow them
  true gouty landlord doth owe them.

  'So have, touched hand,  
  Sweetly supposed mistress heart.
  woeful self, freedom stand,
  fee-simple, part,
  art youth, youth art,
  Threw affections charmed power
  Reserved stalk gave flower.

  'Yet not, equals did,
  Demand him, desired yielded;
  Finding honour forbid,
  safest distance mine honour shielded.
  Experience bulwarks builded
  proofs new-bleeding, remained foil
  false jewel, amorous spoil.

  'But ah, shunned precedent
  destined ill assay?
  forced examples, 'gainst content,
  put by-past perils way?
  Counsel stop awhile stay;  
  rage, advice seen
  blunting make wills keen.

  'Nor satisfaction blood
  curb others' proof,
  forbod sweets good
  fear harms preach behoof.
  O appetite, judgement stand aloof!
  palate hath taste,
  Reason weep, cry thy last.

  'For man's untrue,
  knew patterns foul beguiling;
  Heard plants others' orchards grew;
  deceits gilded smiling;
  Knew vows brokers defiling;
  Thought characters words art,
  bastards foul adulterate heart.

  'And long terms held city,  
  Till 'gan besiege me: "Gentle maid,
  suffering youth feeling pity,
  holy vows afraid.
  ye sworn said;
  feasts love called unto,
  Till ne'er invite woo.

  '"All offences abroad see
  errors blood, mind;
  Love made not; acture be,
  party true kind.
  sought shame shame find;
  shame remains
  reproach contains.

  '"Among mine eyes seen,
  flame heart warmed,
  affection put th' smallest teen,
  leisures charmed.
  Harm them, ne'er harmed;  
  hearts liveries, mine free,
  reigned commanding monarchy.

  '"Look tributes wounded fancies me,
  paled pearls rubies red blood;
  Figuring passions likewise lent me
  grief blushes, aptly understood
  bloodless white encrimsoned mood-
  Effects terror dear modesty,
  Encamped hearts, fighting outwardly.

  '"And, lo, behold talents hair,
  twisted metal amorously empleached,
  receiv'd fair,
  kind acceptance weepingly beseeched,
  annexions fair gems enriched,
  deep-brained sonnets amplify
  stone's dear nature, worth, quality.

  '"The diamond? why, 'twas beautiful hard,  
  Whereto invised properties tend;
  deep-green em'rald, fresh regard
  Weak sights sickly radiance amend;
  heaven-hued sapphire opal blend
  objects manifold; stone,
  wit blazoned, smiled, made moan.

  '"Lo, trophies affections hot,
  pensived subdued desires tender,
  Nature hath charged hoard not,
  yield render-
  is, you, origin ender;
  these, force, oblations be,
  altar, enpatron me.

  '"O advance phraseless hand
  white weighs airy scale praise;
  similes command,
  Hallowed sighs burning lungs raise;
  minister obeys  
  Works you; audit comes
  distract parcels combined sums.

  '"Lo, device nun,
  sister sanctified, holiest note,
  late noble suit court shun,
  rarest havings made blossoms dote;
  sought spirits richest coat,
  cold distance, remove
  spend living eternal love.

  '"But, O sweet, labour is't leave
  thing not, mast'ring strives,
  Playing place form receive,
  Playing patient sports unconstrained gyves!
  fame contrives,
  scars battle scapeth flight,
  makes absence valiant, might.

  '"O pardon boast true!  
  accident brought eye
  moment force subdue,
  caged cloister fly.
  Religious love put religion's eye.
  tempted, immured,
  tempt liberty procured.

  '"How mighty are, O hear tell!
  broken bosoms belong
  emptied fountains well,
  mine pour ocean among.
  strong o'er them, o'er strong,
  victory congest,
  compound love physic cold breast.

  '"My parts pow'r charm sacred nun,
  Who, disciplined, ay, dieted grace,
  Believed eyes t'assail begun,
  vows consecrations giving place,
  O potential love, vow, bond, space,  
  thee hath sting, knot, confine,
  thou art all, things thine.

  '"When thou impressest, precepts worth
  stale example? thou wilt inflame,
  coldly impediments stand forth,
  wealth, filial fear, law, kindred, fame!
  Love's arms peace, 'gainst rule, 'gainst sense, 'gainst shame.
  sweetens, suff'ring pangs bears,
  aloes forces, shocks fears.

  '"Now hearts mine depend,
  Feeling break, bleeding groans pine,
  supplicant sighs extend,
  leave batt'ry make 'gainst mine,
  Lending soft audience sweet design,
  credent soul strong-bonded oath,
  prefer undertake troth."

  'This said, wat'ry eyes dismount,  
  sights till levelled face;
  cheek river running fount
  brinish current downward flowed apace.
  O, channel stream gave grace!
  glazed crystal gate glowing roses
  flame water hue encloses.

  'O father, hell witchcraft lies
  small orb tear!
  inundation eyes
  rocky heart water wear?
  breast cold warmed here?
  O cleft effect! cold modesty, hot wrath,
  fire chill extincture hath.

  'For lo, passion, art craft,
  resolved reason tears;
  white stole chastity daffed,
  Shook sober guards civil fears;
  appears,  
  melting; drops diff'rence bore:
  poisoned me, mine restore.

  'In plenitude subtle matter,
  Applied cautels, strange forms receives,
  burning blushes weeping water,
  swooning paleness; takes leaves,
  either's aptness, deceives,
  blush speeches rank, weep woes,
  turn white swoon tragic shows;

  'That heart level came
  scape hail all-hurting aim,
  Showing fair nature kind tame;
  And, veiled them, win maim.
  thing sought exclaim;
  burned heart-wished luxury,
  preached pure maid praised cold chastity.

  'Thus garment Grace  
  naked concealed fiend covered,
  th' unexperient gave tempter place,
  Which, cherubin, hovered.
  Who, young simple, lovered?
  Ay me, fell, question make
  sake.

  'O, infected moisture eye,
  O, false fire cheek glowed,
  O, forced thunder heart fly,
  O, sad breath spongy lungs bestowed,
  O, borrowed motion, owed,
  betray fore-betrayed,
  pervert reconciled maid.'
